## About

This is the landing page I worked on to complete the landing page task of the Front end development nanodegree from Udacity.  

## Used Languages

I've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this project. 

## Basic Info  

The code I wrote will dynamically create and populate and unordered list with a list element for each section on the page.
When clicked, the user will be smoothly scrolled to the section instead of the default jump. Also, the currently 
active section is distinguished with background bubbles. The navigation menu will also disappear while not scrolling. Finally, a scroll to
top button is added if the user scrolls beyond the fold of the page.
